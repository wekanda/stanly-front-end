PART A: PROJECT DESCRIPTION
Introduction
Uganda Christian University (UCU) encourages innovation and creativity among students through various academic projects and competitions. However, there is currently no centralized digital repository where innovations, research projects, and prototypes from different faculties can be easily accessed, showcased, or referenced by students, lecturers, and potential investors.
You are required to design and develop a web-based repository application called "UCU Innovators Hub", which will serve as a centralized platform to document, showcase, and manage all local projects and innovations created by students at UCU. The platform should promote innovation, visibility, collaboration, and knowledge sharing.
Business Overview
The UCU Innovators Hub will allow students to submit their project details, upload documentation, and link GitHub repositories or live demos. Supervisors and faculty administrators will be able to review, approve, or reject submissions. The platform should also include an interactive public gallery of approved projects and a dashboard for analytics.
Main actors include:
a)	Students: Create accounts, upload and manage their projects.
b)	Supervisors: Review and approve student projects.
c)	Faculty Administrators: Manage users, view analytics, and oversee project categories.
d)	Public Visitors: Browse approved projects and filter by category, faculty, or technology.
Functional Requirements
1.	User Management:
a.	Registration and login for students, supervisors, and admins.
b.	Role-based access (students can upload, supervisors approve; admins manage).
2.	Project Submission and Approval:
a.	Students submit project details, including title, description, category, technologies used, GitHub link, and project document (PDF).
b.	Supervisors can approve, comment, or reject submissions.
c.	Approved projects appear in the public gallery.
3.	Project Repository and Search:
a.	Publicly viewable repository of projects, searchable and filterable by:
	i. 	Faculty, department, category, year, and technology.
b.	Each project should have a detailed page displaying project information and team members.
4.	Analytics and Dashboard:
a.	Admin dashboard showing number of projects per faculty, approval rates, trending technologies, and most active innovators.
b.	Graphs and charts for insights into project submissions and approvals.
5.	Collaboration and Feedback:
a.	Allow comments and feedback on projects (by logged-in users).
b.	Option for students to update their projects post-approval under moderation.
Technical Requirements
1.	Frontend Framework: React, Vue.js, or Angular.
2.	Backend Framework: Node.js (Express), Django, or Laravel.
3.	Database: MySQL, PostgreSQL, or MongoDB.
4.	Authentication: JWT-based secure login and role management.
5.	Responsive design suitable for desktop and mobile.
6.	Data validation, error handling, and a clean user interface.
Deliverables
1.	Source Code: Well-documented frontend and backend repositories.
2.	Documentation:
a.	System architecture and ER diagrams.
b.	User manual and deployment guide.
c.	Testing report and API documentation.
3.	Live Demo: A functional prototype deployed or hosted locally and demonstrated during evaluation.
